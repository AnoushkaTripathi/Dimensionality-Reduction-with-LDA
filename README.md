In this we implement LDA on wine datasets
 
 we standardaize the data and then we calculate the means
 
 with the help of mean we calculate within class scalar matrix and between class scalar matrix 
 
 then we calculate Eigen values and eigen vectors
 
 after that we explain the variance with eigenvvectors and we project the data in graph
